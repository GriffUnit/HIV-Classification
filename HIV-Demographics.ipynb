    "This dataset contains a Ghana Demographic and Health Survey (GDHS) collected by the Ghana Statistical Service (GSS) in 2003. The GDHS report showcases the demographics of 9555 person's who were surveyed and the number of those persons that had the HIV virus. \n",
    "\n",
    "Person's who were tested for the HIV virus were asked a few questions like, their gender, whether they have had sex before, and whether they have had sex within the past year. Their answers were correlated with thier individual HIV test results, and the data was summerized into a table.\n",
    "\n",
    "The purpose of this project is to create a classification model that predicts whether or not a person has the HIV virus based on their individual demographics. This would shed light on the types of people that are most vunerable to contract the virus, and in turn help the Ghana Aids coorporation to direct their resouces towards such persons, bringing efficiency to the fight against HIV prevalence in Ghana.\n",

    "The however the data is not comprehensive enough. Characteristics such as age, educational backgroud, Region, and employment status would have shed more light on the demographics of the most vunerable people."
